## Algorithms and Data Structures Laboratory Works

This repository contains the laboratory works on the course Algorithms and Data Structures implemented by me using C++. The implemented data structures include:

-   lab1 - Array
-   lab2 - Linked List
-   lab3 - Stack
-   lab4 - Queue
-   lab5 - Hash Functions
-   lab6 - Hash Table with Open Hashing (Separate Chaining)
-   lab7 - Hash Table with Closed Hashing (Open Addressing)
-   lab8 - Arbitrary Tree and Operations with it
-   lab9 - Binary Search Tree
-   lab10 - AVL Tree
-   lab11 - Red-Black Tree
-   lab12 - Binary Heap
-   lab13 - Treap

Each data structure has been implemented from scratch, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks.
